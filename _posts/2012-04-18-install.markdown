# Setup recipe for Rails Girls
<span class="muted">Cooking time: 5min active / 15-30min passive</span>

To build apps and other things with Ruby on Rails, we need to setup some software and the developer environment for your computer.

Follow the instructions for your operating system. If you hit into any problems, don&#8217;t panic. Inform us at the event and we can solve it together.

* [Setup for OS X](#setup_for_os_x)
* [Setup for Windows](#setup_for_windows)
* [Setup for Ubuntu](#setup_for_ubuntu)

## Setup for OS X

**Step 1.** Open Terminal.app. Click the Spotlight (magnifying glass icon in the top right corner), type *Terminal.app* and click the option that appears (Picture 1).

**Step 2.** Now copy and paste this line in the Terminal and press Enter.
 
{% highlight sh %}
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/railsgirls/installation-scripts/master/rails-install-osx.sh)
{% endhighlight %}

It should look something like this and finish within a few minutes.

Now we are going to print some information to check that everything is done:

 ,;;;, ,;;;,
;;;' ';' ';;; Should be ruby 1.9.3p194: ruby 1.9.3p194
;;;       ;;;
 ';;,   ,;;'  Should be Rails 3.2.3: Rails 3.2.3
   ';;,;;'
     ';'

Done!
Please restart your terminal.
{% endhighlight %}

Now if everything went right, you just need to open a new Termianl and you should have a working Ruby on Rails programming setup. Congrats!

You also need a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the free code editor Komodo Edit.

* [Download Komodo Edit and install it.](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads)

## Setup for Windows
 
Download [RailsInstaller](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75346/railsinstaller-2.0.0.exe) and run it. Click through the installer using the default options.

## Setup for Ubuntu

To install Ruby on Rails development environment you just need to copy and paste this line in the Terminal and press Enter. Enjoy the text flying on the screen, it will take quite some time. Grabbing a refreshing drink before starting is encouraged.
