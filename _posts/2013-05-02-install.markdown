# Setup recipe for Rails Girls
<span class="muted">Cooking time: 5min active / 15-30min passive</span>

To build apps and other things with Ruby on Rails, we need to setup some software and the developer environment for your computer.

Follow the instructions for your operating system. If you hit into any problems, don&#8217;t panic. Inform us at the event and we can solve it together.

* [Setup for OS X](#setup_for_os_x)
* [Setup for Windows](#setup_for_windows)
* [Setup for Linux](#setup_for_linux)

## Setup for OS X

**Step 1.** Let&#8217;s check the version of the operating system.

Click the Apple menu and choose *About this Mac*.

**Step 2.** In the window you will find the version of your operating system. If your version number starts with 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 or 10.9 this guide is for you. If it&#8217;s something else, we can setup your machine at the event.

**Step 3-A.** Download the RailsInstaller for your version of OS X (For 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8):

* [RailsInstaller for 10.7 and 10.8](http://railsinstaller.s3.amazonaws.com/RailsInstaller-1.0.4-osx-10.7.app.tgz) <span class="muted">(325MB)</span>
* [RailsInstaller for 10.6](http://railsinstaller.s3.amazonaws.com/RailsInstaller-1.0.4-osx-10.6.app.tgz) <span class="muted">(224MB)</span>

Double click the downloaded file and it will unpack it into the current directory. Double click the the newly unpacked 'RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.7.app' or 'RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.6.app' and follow the instructions. It will open a README file with 'Rails Installer OS X' at the top. Please **ignore** the instructions in this file.

If the Rails version wasn't latest, you could update it using a following command on terminal.

{% highlight sh %}
gem update rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure that all works well by running the application generator command.

{% highlight sh %}
rails new railsgirls
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 3-B.** Install with rbenv (For 10.9):

If your version number starts with 10.9, follow these steps. We are installing homebrew and rbenv.

3-B-1. Install Command line tools on terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
xcode-select --install
{% endhighlight %}

3-B-2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

{% highlight sh %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

3-B-3. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv):

{% highlight sh %}
brew update
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

3-B-4. Build Ruby with rbenv:

You can find newest Ruby version with a command "rbenv install -l".

{% highlight sh %}
rbenv install 2.1.0
{% endhighlight %}

If you got "OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: ... : certificate verify failed" error, try this way.

{% highlight sh %}
brew install curl-ca-bundle
cp /usr/local/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt `ruby -ropenssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE'`
{% endhighlight %}

3-B-5. Set default Ruby:

{% highlight sh %}
rbenv global 2.1.0
{% endhighlight %}

3-B-6. Install rails:

{% highlight sh %}
gem i rails
{% endhighlight %}

**Final step.** Install a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the text editor Sublime Text.

* [Download Sublime Text and install it](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

Now you should have a working Ruby on Rails programming setup. Congrats!

## Setup for Windows

Download [RailsInstaller](https://github.com/railsinstaller/railsinstaller-windows/releases/download/2.2.2/railsinstaller-2.2.2.exe) and run it. Click through the installer using the default options.

If the Rails version wasn't latest, you could update it using a following command on "Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails".

{% highlight sh %}
gem update rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure that all works well by running the application generator command.

{% highlight sh %}
rails new railsgirls
{% endhighlight %}

Installation of Git and SSH-keys is required if you want to [put your app online with Heroku](/heroku).

**Final step.** You also need a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the text editor Sublime Text.

* [Download Sublime Text and install it](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

Now you should have a working Ruby on Rails programming setup. Congrats!

## Setup for Linux

To install the Ruby on Rails development environment you just need to copy the line below for your Linux distribution (Ubuntu or Fedora), paste it in the Terminal and press Enter. Enjoy the text flying on the screen; it will take quite some time. Grabbing a refreshing drink before starting is encouraged.

**For Ubuntu:**

{% highlight sh %}
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/railsgirls/installation-scripts/master/rails-install-ubuntu.sh)
{% endhighlight %}

**For Fedora:**

{% highlight sh %}
bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/railsgirls/installation-scripts/master/rails-install-fedora.sh)
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure that all works well by running the application generator command.

{% highlight sh %}
rails new railsgirls
{% endhighlight %}

**Final step.** You also need a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the text editor Sublime Text.
