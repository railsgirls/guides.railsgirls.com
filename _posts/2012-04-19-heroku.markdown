# Put Your App Online With Heroku

*Created by Terence Lee, [@hone02](https://twitter.com/hone02)*

### Get Heroku

Follow steps 1 through 3 of the [quickstart guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) to sign up, install the toolbelt, and login.

__COACH__: Talk about the benefits of deploying to Heroku vs traditional servers.

### Preparing your app

#### Updating our database

First, we need to get our database to work on Heroku, which uses a different database. Please change the following in the Gemfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'sqlite3'
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight ruby %}
group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3'
end
group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Run `bundle install --without production` to setup your dependencies.

__COACH__: You can talk about RDBMS and the different ones out there.

#### Version Control Systems

We need to add our code to version control. You can do this by running the following in the terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
{% endhighlight %}

__COACH__: This would be a good time to talk about version control systems and git.


### Deploying your app

#### App creation

We need to create our heroku app by typing `heroku create --stack cedar` in the terminal and see something like this:

{% highlight sh %}
Creating evening-sky-7498... done, stack is cedar
http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:evening-sky-7498.git
Git remote heroku added
{% endhighlight %}

In this case "evening-sky-7498" is your app name.

#### Pushing the code

Next we need to push our code to heroku by typing `git push heroku master`. You'll see push output like the following:

{% highlight sh %}
Counting objects: 134, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (115/115), done.
Writing objects: 100% (134/134), 35.29 KiB, done.
Total 134 (delta 26), reused 0 (delta 0)

-----> Heroku receiving push
-----> Ruby/Rails app detected
-----> Installing dependencies using Bundler version 1.1.2
       Running: bundle install --without development:test --path vendor/bundle --binstubs bin/ --deployment
       Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.......
...
-----> Launching... done, v4
       http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku
{% endhighlight %}

You'll know the app is done being pushed, when you see the "Launching..." text like above.

#### Migrate database

Next we need to migrate our database like we did locally during the workshop: `heroku run rake db:migrate`

When that command is finished being run, you can hit the app based on the url. For this example app, you can go to [http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com/](http://evening-sky-7498.herokuapp.com). You can also type `heroku open` in the terminal to visit the page.
