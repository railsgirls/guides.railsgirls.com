# Start of the guide

Welcome to the Rails Girls guides! In these guides you'll learn how to make an app using the Ruby on Rails framework (which is why this event is called _Rails_ Girls). When you have made your first app, you'll deploy it to a hosting service so that you can view it on the Internet and share it with others.

Please follow the numbered guides in order. Each guide assumes you followed the previous guide. When you're done with the workshop and/or completed all the numbered guides, feel free to explore the [other guides](/#other-guides) as well. Ask you coach for suggestions!

The first guides help you get set up with the tools you'll need and installing Rails on your machine. Use the __Guides__ list lower on this page to navigate your way to the next guide.

If you want to get a taste of Ruby in a 30 minute course, go to [try.ruby-lang.org](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) before you start. You'll also have to opportunity to do so during the workshop.
