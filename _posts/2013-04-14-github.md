# Push Your App to GitHub

*Created by Alyson La, [@realalysonla](https://www.twitter.com/realalysonla)*

## Things you need before you get started

### Git & GitHub

* Check if Git is installed
	* In the terminal type `git --version` (1.8 or higher preferred)

* If not, download Git [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
	Then, setup your local Git profile - In the terminal:
	* Type `git config --global user.name "your-name"`
	* Type `git config --global user.email "your-email"`

	* _To check if Git is already config-ed you can type_ `git config --list`

* Create a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account or login if you already have one

**COACH:** Talk a little about git, version control, and open source

## Push your app to GitHub using the command line

On your GitHub profile click "new repo" ![screen shot 2013-06-01 at 12 38 50 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2623954/595307/eb70c6cc-caf2-11e2-9d2d-60deb31ac049.png) give it a name (example: rails-girls), brief description, choose the "public" repo option, and click "create repository".

In the command line--make sure you `cd` into your railgirls folder--and type:

{% highlight sh %}
git init
{% endhighlight %}

This initializes a git repository in your project

*Note:* If you've already done the [Heroku guide](/heroku), then you've already initialized a git repository & you can move on to the next steps.

Next check if a file called `READEME.rdoc` exists in your railsgirl directory:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight sh %}
ls README.rdoc
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  <div class="win">
{% highlight sh %}
dir README.rdoc
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

If the file doesn't exist, create it by typing:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight sh %}
touch README.rdoc
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  <div class="win">
{% highlight sh %}
type nul > README.rdoc
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

**COACH:** Talk a little about README.rdoc

Then type:

{% highlight sh %}
git status
{% endhighlight %}

This will list out all the files in your working directory.

**COACH:** Talk about some of your favorite git commands

Then type:

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
{% endhighlight %}

This adds in all of your files & changes so far to a staging area.

Then type:

{% highlight sh %}
git commit -m "first commit"
{% endhighlight %}

This commits all of your files, adding the message "first commit"

Next type:

{% highlight sh %}
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/rails-girls.git
{% endhighlight %}

_Your GitHub Repository page will list the repository URL, so feel free to copy and paste from there, rather than typing it in manually. You can copy and paste the link from your GitHub repository page by clicking the clipboard icon next to the URL._

This creates a remote, or _connection_, named "origin" pointing at the GitHub repository you just created.

Then type:

{% highlight sh %}
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

This sends your commits in your "master" branch to GitHub

Congratulations your app is on GitHub! Go check it out by going to the same url you used above: https://github.com/username/rails-girls (without the .git part)

If you want to continue making changes and pushing them to GitHub you'll just need to use the following three commands:

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "type your commit message here"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}
