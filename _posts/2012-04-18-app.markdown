# Rails Girls App Tutorial

<span class="muted">*Created by Vesa Vänskä, [@vesan](https://twitter.com/vesan)* and improved by many</span>

## Step 1: Create the application

### Before we start

The commands you need to run on a Windows computer are slightly different to Mac or Linux.
Select your operating system using the switcher at the bottom-right:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
    {% highlight text %}
    The tutorial will show the commands for Mac or Linux.
    {% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <div class="win">
    {% highlight text %}
    The tutorial will show the commands for Windows.
    {% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>


### Let's start

We're going to create a new Rails app called *railsgirls*.


First, let's open a terminal:

* **Windows**: Click Start and look for *Command Prompt*, then click *Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails*.
* **Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora)**: Search for *Terminal* on the dash and click *Terminal*.
* **Mac OS X**: Open Spotlight, type *Terminal* and click the *Terminal* application.

___

Next, type this command in the terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir projects
{% endhighlight %}

You can verify that a directory named <code>projects</code> was created by running the **directory listing command**:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
  {% highlight sh %}
  ls
  {% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <div class="win">
  {% highlight sh %}
  dir
  {% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

You should see the <code>projects</code> directory in the output.

___

Now you want to change the current directory to the <code>projects</code> folder by running:


{% highlight sh %}
cd projects
{% endhighlight %}

You can verify that now you are in an empty directory or folder by running again the directory listing command.

___

Now you want to create a new app called <code>railsgirls</code> by running:

{% highlight sh %}
rails new railsgirls
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a new app in the folder <code>railsgirls</code>, so again change the directory to be inside of our rails app by running:

{% highlight sh %}
cd railsgirls
{% endhighlight %}


If you run the directory listing command inside of the directory, you should see folders such as <code>app</code> and <code>config</code>.

### Command prompt

Notice that the place where you can enter commands ends with a symbol:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight text %}
$
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
  <div class="win">
{% highlight text %}
>
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

This symbol is called the **command prompt**, and when you see it you know that you can enter commands in the Terminal.


### Start the application

You can start the application by running:

{% highlight sh %}
rails server
{% endhighlight %}

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see the "Welcome aboard" page, which means that the generation of your new app worked correctly.

Going back to the Terminal window, notice that now the command prompt is not visible because the Rails server took control of the window. When you don't see the command prompt, you cannot enter commands in the Terminal.


To return to the normal command prompt, hit `CTRL-C` in the terminal to quit the server. (Now that the server isn't working, refreshing [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser will show an error page.)



**Coach:** Explain what each command does. What was generated? What does the server do?

## Step 2: Create a page

Lets add a page to our app; it will show information about the author of this application — you!

{% highlight sh %}
rails generate controller pages info
{% endhighlight %}

This command will create you a new folder under `app/views` called `pages` and under that a file called `info.html.erb`, which will be your info page.

___

Now open the file `app/views/pages/info.html.erb` and inspect its contents. What you see there was generated automatically, and it is written in a language called HTML.


**Coach:** Talk briefly about routes (interface between URL and the app), Controllers and Views.

___

Start the server again:

{% highlight sh %}
rails server
{% endhighlight %}

Open [http://localhost:3000/pages/info](http://localhost:3000/pages/info) in your browser to see the info page and try to figure out the connection between what is written in the `app/views/pages/info.html.erb` file and what you see in the browser (or ask your coach :D)

**Coach:** Explain what are HTML tags and what they are useful for. Explain `<h1>` and `<p>`.

___

Now, replace the generated text with some useful information. You can add whatever you want, for example some text about yourself.

Afterwards, refresh the page [http://localhost:3000/pages/info](http://localhost:3000/pages/info) in the browser to see the information that you added.

___

To experiment a bit more with HTML, you can play with the editor from [http://htmledit.squarefree.com/](http://htmledit.squarefree.com/).

Or you can ask your coach to show you more HTML tags and see how they work.


## Step 3: Create the `Idea` scaffold

We're going to use Rails' scaffold functionality to generate a starting point that allows us to list, add, remove, edit, and view things; in our case ideas.

**Coach:** What is Rails scaffolding? Explain the command, the model name and related database table, naming conventions, attributes and types, etc. What are migrations and why do you need them?

___

In the Terminal, stop the Rails server by hitting `CTRL-C`. You should see the Command Prompt again (which means you can give it commands). Run

{% highlight sh %}
rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string
{% endhighlight %}

The scaffold creates new files in your project directory, but to get it to work properly we need to run a couple of other commands to update our database and restart the server.

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight sh %}
bin/rake db:migrate
rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <div class="win">
{% highlight sh %}
ruby bin/rake db:migrate
rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

**Coach:** Talk about the separation between the application and the database.

Open [http://localhost:3000/ideas](http://localhost:3000/ideas) in your browser. Click around and test what you got by running these few command-line commands.

When you're done exploring, hit `CTRL-C` in the Terminal to quit the server again.

___

**Coach:** Talk about dynamic websites, about saving data in a database and retrieving it. Explain Models and how they are used in Controllers. Talk about showing dynamic data in Views, using Embedded Ruby (ERB). Recap MVC, its the parts and their relationship to each other.


## Step 4: Design


The app doesn't look very nice yet. Let's do something about that.

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a free collection of styles that look nice. By including it in a web page, and following their conventions on how to structure the HTML, you get a nice style without much effort.

Open `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` in your text editor and above the line

{% highlight erb %}
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" />
{% endhighlight %}

and replace

{% highlight erb %}
<%= yield %>
{% endhighlight %}

with

{% highlight erb %}
<div class="container">
  <%= yield %>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's also add a navigation bar and footer to the layout. In the same file, under `<body>` add

{% highlight html %}
<nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">The Idea app</a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        <li><a href="/ideas">Ideas</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
{% endhighlight %}

and before `</body>` add

{% highlight html %}
<footer>
  <div class="container">
    Rails Girls 2014
  </div>
</footer>
<script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Open `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` and at the bottom add

{% highlight css %}
body { padding-top: 100px; }
footer { margin-top: 100px; }
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure you saved your files and refresh the browser to see the style improvements. Make a connection between the HTML that you added in the files and what you see in the browser.

___

Now, the table looks a bit crammed. Let's fix that! In the same file, `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`, at the bottom add

{% highlight css %}
table, td, th { vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding: 5px 10px;}
th { border-bottom: 1px solid #DDD; }
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file again and refresh the browser to see what was changed.

**Coach:** Talk a little about CSS and layouts.

### Play more if you want to



___

You can also change the HTML &amp; CSS of your Ideas website - tell your coach what you'd like to do and they'll help you.

One example would be to add, in the header, a link to the information page (from Step 1). Open `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` and in the middle, after

{% highlight html %}
          <li><a href="/ideas">Ideas</a></li>
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight html %}
          <li><a href="/pages/info">About</a></li>
{% endhighlight %}




## Step 5: Add picture uploads

We need to install a piece of software to let us upload files in Rails.

**Coach:** Explain what libraries are and why they are useful. Describe what open source software is.

In the text editor, open `Gemfile` and under the line

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'sqlite3'
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'carrierwave'
{% endhighlight %}

In the terminal, stop the server by pressing `CTRL-C`, and run the command that loads the new library:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle
{% endhighlight %}


___

Now we can generate the code for handling uploads. In the terminal run:

{% highlight sh %}
rails generate uploader Picture
{% endhighlight %}


The `Idea` model needs to know that its `picture` field is a file, not just some text. To do that, open `app/models/idea.rb` and under the line

{% highlight ruby %}
class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight ruby %}
mount_uploader :picture, PictureUploader
{% endhighlight %}

The view that allows to create or edit images needs to show a field for selecting a file instead of a text field. To do that, open `app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb` and change

{% highlight erb %}
<%= f.text_field :picture %>
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight erb %}
<%= f.file_field :picture %>
{% endhighlight %}


Also, change the line

{% highlight erb %}
<%= form_for(@idea) do |f| %>
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight erb %}
<%= form_for(@idea, :html => {:multipart => true}) do |f| %>
{% endhighlight %}

___

Now let's start the server again. In the Terminal, you can press the UP arrow (repeatedly) to see the commands that you entered before. When you find `rails server`, hit enter to start the server again.

In your browser, in the ideas page, [http://localhost:3000/ideas](http://localhost:3000/ideas), add a new idea with a picture.

When you upload a picture, it would be nice to actually see it, but fow now it only shows the path to the file. Let's fix that: open `app/views/ideas/show.html.erb` and change

{% highlight erb %}
<%= @idea.picture %>
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight erb %}
<%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url, :width => 600) if @idea.picture.present? %>
{% endhighlight %}

Now refresh your browser to see what changed.


## Step 6: Finetune the routes

When you open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) it still shows the "Welcome aboard" page. Let's make it redirect to the ideas page.

Open `config/routes.rb` and after the first line add

{% highlight ruby %}
root :to => redirect('/ideas')
{% endhighlight %}

Test the change by opening the root path - [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) - in your browser.

**Coach:** Talk about routes, and include details on the order of routes and their relation to static files.
