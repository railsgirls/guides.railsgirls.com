# Put your app online

{% include main-guide-intro.html %}

Now that you have you very first app made, let's share it with others by putting it online!

Once you're done with one of the following guides, you'll have a URL that people can enter in their browser and see what you made today. During the workshop you can continue working on your app (by following these guides), and deploying new and improved versions of your app.

There are many services that can host your app. They all are slightly different. Ask your coach which service they recommend.

__COACH__: Please help choose the best, and possibly free, service to deploy the app. Preferably a PaaS like Heroku.
