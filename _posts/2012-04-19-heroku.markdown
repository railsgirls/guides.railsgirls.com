# Put Your App Online With Heroku

*Created by Terence Lee, [@hone02](https://twitter.com/hone02)*

### Get Heroku

Follow steps "Introduction" and "Set up" of the
[Getting Started on Heroku with Ruby][heroku-guide] to sign up, install the
Heroku CLI, and login.

__COACH__: Talk about the benefits of deploying to Heroku vs traditional servers.

[heroku-guide]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#introduction

### Preparing your app

#### Version Control Systems

We need to add our code to version control. You can do this by running the
following in the terminal:

{% highlight sh %}
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
{% endhighlight %}

__COACH__: This would be a good time to talk about version control systems and git.

#### Updating our database

First, we need to get our database to work on Heroku, which uses a different
database. Please change the following in the Gemfile:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'sqlite3'
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight ruby %}
group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3'
end
group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Run `bundle install --without production` to setup your dependencies.

Don't forget to do `git add .` and `git commit -m "Use postgres as production database"`
in order to add this change to your master branch before pushing to heroku later.

__COACH__: You can talk about RDBMS and the different ones out there, plus
include some details on Heroku's dependency on PostgreSQL.

### Deploying your app

#### App creation

We need to create our Heroku app by typing `heroku create` in the terminal and
see something like this:

{% highlight sh %}
Creating app... done, ⬢ young-reaches-87845
https://young-reaches-87845.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/young-reaches-87845.git
{% endhighlight %}

In this case "young-reaches-87845" is your app name.

#### Pushing the code

Next we need to push our code to heroku by typing `git push heroku master`.
You'll see push output like the following:

{% highlight sh %}
Counting objects: 115, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (97/97), done.
Writing objects: 100% (115/115), 25.62 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 115 (delta 10), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Compressing source files... done.

remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/young-reaches-87845.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
{% endhighlight %}

You'll know the app is done being pushed, when you see the "Launching..." text like above.

#### Migrate database

Next we need to migrate our database like we did locally during the workshop:

{% highlight sh %}
heroku run rails db:migrate
{% endhighlight %}

When that command is finished being run, you can hit the app based on the url.
For this example app, you can go to <https://young-reaches-87845.herokuapp.com/>.
You can also type `heroku open` in the terminal to visit the page.

#### Closing notes

Heroku's platform is not without its quirks. Applications run on Heroku live
within an ephermeral environment — this means that (except for information
stored in your database) any files created by your application will disappear
if it restarts (for example, when you push a new version).

###### [Ephemeral filesystem][ephemeral-filesystem]

> Each dyno gets its own ephemeral filesystem, with a fresh copy of the most
> recently deployed code. During the dyno’s lifetime its running processes can
> use the filesystem as a temporary scratchpad, but no files that are written
> are visible to processes in any other dyno and any files written will be
> discarded the moment the dyno is stopped or restarted. For example, this
> occurs any time a dyno is replaced due to application deployment and
> approximately once a day as part of normal dyno management.

In the [App](/app) tutorial the ability to attach a file to the Idea record is
added, which results in new files being written to your applications
`public/uploads` folder. The ephemeral storage in Heroku can be seen with the
following steps:

1. Launch the app with `heroku open`
2. Add a new Idea with an image
3. Restart the application by running `heroku restart`
4. Go back to your Idea and reload the page - the image should no longer be visible

##### Working around Ephemeral Storage

Obviously this doesn't seem to be useful if you were running a real life
application, but there are ways to work around this which is commonly used by
a lot of popular websites.

The most common method is to use an external asset host such as Amazon S3 (Simple
Storage Service) or Rackspace CloudFiles. These services provide (for a low cost
- usually less then $0.10 per GB) storage 'in the cloud' (meaning the files
could potentially be hosted anywhere) which your application can use as persistent storage.

While this functionality is a bit out of scope for this tutorial there are some
resources available which you can use to find your way:

* [How to: Make Carrierwave work on Heroku](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/wiki/How-to%3A-Make-Carrierwave-work-on-Heroku)
* [Amazon S3 – The Beginner’s Guide](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/amazon-s3-the-beginners-guide/)

As always if you require any more information or assistance your coaches will be able to assist.
