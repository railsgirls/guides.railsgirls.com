# Rails Girls Guides

The purpose of Rails Girls is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet.

Rails Girls was founded at the end of 2010 in Helsinki. Originally intended as a one-time event, we never thought to see so many chapters from all around the world! This guide will help you get started.

You can use our materials and instructions to roll out your own workshop in your city, workplace or kitchen! Read more about Rails Girls at http://railsgirls.com

## Quick start

View the guides at http://guides.railsgirls.com or clone this repo and install & run [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

### Installing jekyll

```
$ cd railsgirls.github.io
```

```
$ bundle install
```

### Pygments and Code Highlighting

The guides use the [pygments](http://pygments.org/) library to do syntax highlighting. If you don't have it installed you won't be able to see the highlight sections like the following:

```
{% highlight %}
{% endhighlight %}
```

If you aren't editing the code blocks, you can safely ignore this. If you want pygments, you can follow the [install instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in the "Pygments" section.

### Run jekyll

```
$ bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```

### Styling

Wrap keyboard shortcuts with [kbd](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/kbd) HTML tag.

To make posts consistent in style use `Ctrl+C` over `CTRL-c`/`ctrl+c`

```
To shut down the server you can hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
```

### Having trouble?

You might find some useful hints in this jekyll issue if it's not working as expected: [Issue 503](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/503)
