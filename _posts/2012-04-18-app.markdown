# Rails Girls App Tutorial

*Created by Vesa Vänskä, [@vesan](https://twitter.com/vesan)*

**Make sure you have Rails installed.** [**Follow the installation guide**](/install) to get set up.


## Get to know the tools

<div class="indent" markdown="1">

<h3><i class="icon-text-editor">&nbsp;</i></h3>
### Text Editor

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit), Vim, Emacs, and Gedit are examples of text editors your can use for writing code and editing files.

<h3><i class="icon-prompt">&nbsp;</i></h3>
### Terminal (known as Command Prompt on Windows)
Where you start the rails server and run commands.

<h3><i class="icon-browser">&nbsp;</i></h3>
### Web browser
(Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for viewing your application.

</div>


## *1.*Creating the application

We're going to create a new Rails app called *railsgirls*.

First, let's open a terminal:

* Mac OS X: Open Spotlight, type *Terminal* and click the *Terminal* application.
* Windows: Click Start and look for *Command Prompt*, then click *Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails*.
* Linux (Ubuntu): Search for *Terminal* on the dash and click *Terminal*.

Next, type these commands in the terminal:

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight sh %}
mkdir projects
cd projects
rails new railsgirls
cd railsgirls
rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <div class="win">
{% highlight sh %}
mkdir projects
cd projects
rails new railsgirls
cd railsgirls
ruby script\rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see "Welcome aboard" page, which means that the generation of your new app worked correctly.

Hit `CTRL-C` in the terminal to quit the server.

**Coach:** Explain what each command does. What was generated? What does the server do?


## *2.*Create Idea scaffold

We're going to use Rails' scaffold functionality to generate a starting point that allows us to list, add, remove, edit, and view things; in our case ideas.

**Coach:** What is Rails scaffolding? (Explain the command, the model name and related database table, naming conventions, attributes and types, etc.) What are migrations and why do you need them?

<div class="os-specific">
  <div class="nix">
{% highlight sh %}
rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string
rake db:migrate
rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>

  <div class="win">
{% highlight sh %}
rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string
rake db:migrate
ruby script\rails server
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

Open [http://localhost:3000/ideas](http://localhost:3000/ideas) in your browser. Click around and test what you got by running these few command-line commands.

Hit `CTRL-C` to quit the server again when you've clicked around a little.


## *3.*Design

**Coach:** Talk about the relationship between HTML and Rails. What part of views is HTML and what is Embedded Ruby (ERB)? What is MVC and how does this relate to it? (Models and controllers are responsible for generating the HTML views.)

The app doesn't look very nice yet. Let's do something about that. We'll use the Twitter Bootstrap project to give us nicer styling really easily.

Open `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` in your text editor and above the line

{% highlight erb %}
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight erb %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap.css">
{% endhighlight %}

and replace

{% highlight erb %}
<%= yield %>
{% endhighlight %}

with

{% highlight erb %}
<div class="container">
  <%= yield %>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's also add a navigation bar and footer to the layout. In the same file, under `<body>` add

{% highlight html %}
<div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <div class="container">
      <a class="brand" href="/">The Idea app</a>
      <ul class="nav">
        <li class="active"><a href="/ideas">Ideas</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

and before `</body>` add

{% highlight html %}
<footer>
  <div class="container">
    Rails Girls 2013
  </div>
</footer>
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's also change the styling of the ideas table. Open `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` and at the bottom add

{% highlight css %}
body { padding-top: 100px; }
footer { margin-top: 100px; }
table, td, th { vertical-align: middle !important; border: none !important; }
th { border-bottom: 1px solid #DDD !important; }
{% endhighlight %}

Now refresh the browser to see what was changed. You can also change the HTML & CSS further.

**Coach:** Talk a little about CSS and layouts.


## Step 4: Adding picture uploads

We need to install a piece of software to let us upload files in Rails.

Open `Gemfile` in the project directory using your text editor and under the line

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'sqlite3'
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'carrierwave'
{% endhighlight %}

**Coach:** Explain what libraries are and why they are useful. Describe what open source software is.

In the terminal run:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle
{% endhighlight %}

At this point you need to **restart the Rails server process** in the terminal. This is needed for the app to load the added library.

Now we can generate the code for handling uploads. In the terminal run:

{% highlight sh %}
rails generate uploader Picture
{% endhighlight %}

Open `app/models/idea.rb` and under the line

{% highlight ruby %}
class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base
{% endhighlight %}

add

{% highlight ruby %}
mount_uploader :picture, PictureUploader
{% endhighlight %}

Open `app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb` and change

{% highlight erb %}
<%= f.text_field :picture %>
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight erb %}
<%= f.file_field :picture %>
{% endhighlight %}

In your browser, add new idea with a picture. When you upload a picture it doesn't look nice because it only shows a path to the file, so let's fix that.

Open `app/views/ideas/show.html.erb` and change

{% highlight erb %}
<%= @idea.picture %>
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight erb %}
<%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url, :width => 600) if @idea.picture.present? %>
{% endhighlight %}

Now refresh your browser to see what changed.

**Coach:** Talk a little about HTML.


## Step 5: Finetune the routes

If you try to open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) it still shows the "Welcome aboard" page. Let's make it redirect to the ideas page.

Open `config/routes.rb` and after the first line add

{% highlight ruby %}
root :to => redirect('/ideas')
{% endhighlight %}

Test the change by opening the root path in your browser.

**Coach:** Talk about routes.


## What next?

* Add design using HTML &amp; CSS
* Add ratings
* Use CoffeeScript (or JavaScript) to add interaction
* Add picture resizing to make loading the pictures faster
