# Setup recipe for Rails Girls
<span class="muted">Cooking time: 5min active / 15-30min passive</span>

To build apps and other things with Ruby on Rails, we need to setup some software and the developer environment for your computer.

Follow the instructions for your operating system. If you hit into any problems, don&#8217;t panic. Inform us at the event and we can solve it together.

* [Setup for OS X](#setup_for_os_x)
* [Setup for Windows](#setup_for_windows)
* [Setup for Ubuntu](#setup_for_ubuntu)

## Setup for OS X

**Step 1.** Let&#8217;s check the version of the operating system.

Click the Apple menu and choose *About this Mac*.

**Step 2.** In the window you will find the version of your operating system. If your version number starts with 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8 this guide is for you. If it&#8217;s something else, we can setup your machine at the event.

**Step 3.** Download the RailsInstaller for your version of OS X:

* [RailsInstaller for 10.7 and 10.8](https://github.com/downloads/railsinstaller/railsinstaller-nix/RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.7.app.tgz) <span class="muted">(325MB)</span>
* [RailsInstaller for 10.6](https://github.com/downloads/railsinstaller/railsinstaller-nix/RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.6.app.tgz) <span class="muted">(224MB)</span>

Double click the downloaded file and it will unpack it into the current directory. Double click the the newly unpacked 'RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.7.app' or 'RailsInstaller-1.0.3-osx-10.6.app' and follow the instructions. It will open a README file with 'Rails Installer OS X' at the top. Please **ignore** the instructions in this file.

**Final step.** Install a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the free code editor Komodo Edit.

* [Download Komodo Edit and install it.](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads)

## Setup for Windows

Download [RailsInstaller](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75346/railsinstaller-2.0.0.exe) and run it. Click through the installer using the default options.

You also need a text editor to edit code files. For the workshop we recommend the free code editor Komodo Edit.

Now you should have a working Ruby on Rails programming setup. Congrats!
